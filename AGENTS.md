## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Python 3.14+
- **Orchestration**: [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) & [Deep Agents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents)
- **Execution**: `langchain-modal` (`ModalSandbox`) for sandboxed shell execution in ephemeral Modal microVMs
- **Models**: Anthropic (default), OpenAI, or Google GenAI via LangChain `init_chat_model`
- **Environment**: `uv` for dependency management, `pydantic-settings` for configuration

## Code Conventions

### General
- Python **3.14+** minimum.
- **Async-first where applicable** — use `async def` for I/O-bound functions (Modal sandbox calls, LLM calls, file operations).
- **Strict type hints** on every function signature, including return types. No bare `Any` unless unavoidable.
- **Docstrings on every function and class** using Google-style format.

### Environment Variables
- All secrets and configuration come from `.env` via `python-dotenv`.
- Access config only through the `Settings` object in `config.py` (Pydantic `BaseSettings`).
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or connection strings.

---

## Testing

- Test runner: `uv run pytest`
- Always follow Red–Green–Refactor TDD
- Use `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Tests are co-located with their target** — a test for `config.py` lives at `config_test.py`, a test for `runtime/workspace.py` lives at `runtime/workspace_test.py`, not in a separate `tests/` directory.
- Test files are named `<module>_test.py` and live in the same directory as the module they test.
- Mock all external services (Modal, Anthropic/OpenAI/Google) in unit tests — never hit live APIs in tests.
- Integration tests that require a live sandbox are marked `@pytest.mark.integration` and skipped by default.
- Shared fixtures live in `conftest.py` at the project root (or a local `conftest.py` for directory-scoped fixtures).

## Linting & Formatting

Ruff is the single tool for both linting and formatting.

## What NOT to Do

- Do not commit `.env` (it is in `.gitignore`)
- Do not use `pip install` — always use `uv add`
- Do not use bare `except:` — always catch specific exceptions
